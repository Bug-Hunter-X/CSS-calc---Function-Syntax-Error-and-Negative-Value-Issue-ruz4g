The following CSS code uses the `calc()` function to calculate the width of an element, but it contains a syntax error that can cause unexpected behavior or rendering issues in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```

The error is that there is no space between the `100%` and the `-` operator. The correct syntax is to have a space before and after the operator.  This is a common error when using `calc()`.

Another problem could be that the calculation results in a negative value. If the 10px is larger than the width available, this will produce an error.
